# We install the PyCSH Python package using pip3, but this is somehow more painful than Meson...
# pip3 very much prefers to skip installing packages,
# if it finds that they are already installed with the 'same' version.
# This would be all well and good, if it didn't determine the version from pyproject.toml,
# which we don't really care to maintain when we otherwise use git SHA/tags.
# So either uninstall pycsh first or use --force-reinstall
#pip3 uninstall -y pycsh
# Build in builddir-pip, so we can assume that we will only find 1 .whl
python3 -mpip wheel -w builddir-pip . && \
# installing the .whl seems to also install the .pyi file, so that's nice
pip3 install --force-reinstall $(ls builddir-pip/pycsh*.whl)
