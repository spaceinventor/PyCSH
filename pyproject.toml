# We need to install the targets of the lib/pycsh_core/ subproject, since we now defer the targets to that dependency.
#   Normally all subproject targets would be installed, but we have to skip the CSP subproject, which causes errors due to header files not being in the Python wheel (maybe just for now?)
#   P.S Many thanks to JB
